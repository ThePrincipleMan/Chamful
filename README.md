# Chamful : An Indian Ludo

## Introduction
Chamful is a popular board game played predominantly in Maharashtra under various different name. I created this project to learn WebSockets while also being able to play it with my family, wherever we may be.

## Overview

### Frontend
The frontend for the project is created using reactjs framework for quick and easy set up of an inital working frontend prototype. This helped me focus more of attention on the backend part. Further styling changes can be easily incorporated onto the existing codebase

### Backend
Backend is powered by Node.js with WebSockets being used for its near realtime response. Various different functions are implemented for various different steps associated with the game, called mainly using websocket .on functionality.
